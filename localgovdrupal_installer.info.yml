# A list of forms that should be presented to the user before choosing database
# settings and installing the system. Each of these forms must implement
# \Drupal\RecipeKit\Installer\FormInterface.
forms:
  - '\Drupal\RecipeKit\Installer\Form\RecipesForm'
  - '\Drupal\RecipeKit\Installer\Form\SiteNameForm'

recipes:
  # This should be a list of recipes' Composer package names that should always be
  # applied during the install process.
  required: [
    'millnut/localgovdrupal_starter'
  ]

  # A list of recipe package names that will be applied if no additional recipes
  # are chosen by the user.
  default: []

  # This should be a set of recipe combinations to show to the user as choices at the
  # start of the install process. The keys can be any machine name (such as `blog`),
  # and the values should be associative arrays with two elements:
  # - `name`: The human-readable name of the combination, which will be shown to users.
  # - `packages`: A list of the Composer package names of the recipes in this combination.
  #
  # Example:
  #
  # special:
  #   name: Special Sauce
  #   packages:
  #     - drupal/drupal_cms_blog
  #     - kanopi/gin-admin-experience
  #
  optional: {}

# This allows you to suppress messages set by the Drupal installer, or various modules,
# which you might not want to display to users during or after the install process.
# Each item in this list can either be a string, which is the untranslated message
# to suppress, or an array of two untranslated strings for pluralized messages which
# have singular and plural forms.
hide_messages:
  # If installed in a language other than English, don't show these confusing
  # technical messages about how many translations were imported.
  # @see locale_translate_batch_finished()
  - ['One translation file imported. %number translations were added, %update translations were updated and %delete translations were removed.', '@count translation files imported. %number translations were added, %update translations were updated and %delete translations were removed.']
  - 'The configuration was successfully updated. There are %number configuration objects updated.'

  # This appears mid-install if you install in a non-English language, which is confusing.
  - 'Check <a href=":translate_status">available translations</a> for your language(s).'


# This allows the installer to download the appropriate translations if needed; don't
# change it unless you know what you're doing.
